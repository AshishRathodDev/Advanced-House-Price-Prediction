# Advanced House Price Prediction

A Machine Learning model to predict house prices using the [Kaggle House Prices dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). This project implements advanced regression techniques to predict residential property prices with high accuracy.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting house prices using 79 explanatory variables. The model combines multiple algorithms including Linear Regression, XGBoost, and Random Forest to achieve optimal prediction accuracy. The implementation includes comprehensive feature engineering and hyperparameter optimization.

## Key Features

- Advanced feature engineering and preprocessing
- Ensemble learning with multiple models
- Hyperparameter optimization
- Cross-validation and model evaluation
- Feature importance analysis
- Model deployment pipeline

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AshishRathodDev/Advanced-House-Price-Prediction.git
cd Advanced-House-Price-Prediction
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # (Windows: venv\Scripts\activate)
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main components:
- `data/`: Dataset storage and management
- `models/`: Trained model storage
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for analysis
- `src/`: Source code for data processing, feature engineering, and model training
- `tests/`: Unit tests and validation

## Usage

1. Data Preparation:
```bash
python src/data/prepare_data.py
```

2. Feature Engineering:
```bash
python src/features/build_features.py
```

3. Model Training:
```bash
python src/models/train_model.py
```

4. Making Predictions:
```bash
python src/models/predict.py
```

## Model Performance

The model's performance is evaluated using multiple metrics:
- RÂ² Score: Measures the proportion of variance explained
- RMSE: Root Mean Square Error for prediction accuracy
- MAE: Mean Absolute Error for prediction bias

## Model Limitations

- The model's accuracy may vary based on market conditions
- Predictions are most reliable for properties within the training data range
- External factors not included in the dataset may affect actual prices

## Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing pipeline includes:
- Handling missing values
- Feature scaling and normalization
- Outlier detection and treatment
- Categorical variable encoding
- Feature selection and dimensionality reduction

## Deployment

To deploy the model:
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed
2. Load the trained model
3. Prepare input data in the required format
4. Run predictions using the provided scripts

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
- Data format mismatches: Ensure input data follows the expected schema
- Memory issues: Adjust batch size in configuration
- Model loading errors: Verify model file path and format
